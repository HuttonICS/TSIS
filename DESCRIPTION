Description: Alternative splicing (AS) is an essential process in plant and animal
    genomes, which regulates protein abundance and increases the protein biodiversity.
    In the AS regulation, one of the cases is a pair of isoforms
    from the same gene reverse their relative expression abundance (usage) at some stress
    reaction points, denoting as isoform switch event. Isoform switches often play pivotal
    roles in re-programming of gene regulation in response to biotic and abiotic stimuli,
    for instance the transcript isoform degradation of nonsense-mediated decay in a
    surveillance pathway. This package is used to determine, score and visualize the isoform
    switch patterns in isoform expression time-series data. All the analyses have
    been integrated into a Shiny App, in which users can implement analysis as easy as mouse click.
